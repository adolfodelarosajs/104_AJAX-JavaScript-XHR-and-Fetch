**In Detail**

This course covers making AJAX requests using the XMLHttpRequest as well as the newer fetch. Typically when a user goes to a website the user has to wait for the server to respond with the data.

The possibilities are endless, using JavaScript to send requests, receive response content and use the response data to output into the html. JavaScript is at the center of it all connecting the web page and provides you a wide variety of options where you can take the code provided within this course and extend on it in any number of directions. Learn practice and have fun.
